**Brief introduction
===========================================================================
  In this project, we have to merge a few txt files about human activity into one file.
Following is the way and step how I do so.

**Cleaning Step
===============================================================================
  I decide to deal the inertial signal files first. Including two folders: text and train
Following step apply on both folders. There are nine files in each folder, as following:
--body_acc_x¡Bbody_acc_y¡Bbody_acc_z, body_gyro_x ~ body_gyro_z, total_acc_x ~ total_acc_z.
I summarize the file, variable can be represented by their mean and standard deviation.
Then mix these nine files¡Beighteen variables into one file called: Signal

  After deal with signal, there are three files: X¡BY and subject. We also summarize their
variables by mean and standard deviation. We creat a new label variable called: Test_Train,
to tell where the sample come from after combining.

**Data Information
===============================================================================
1.Test_Train: label to tell test or train data. 1:test, 2:train
2.Subject: The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
